This is a script to send automated emails. 
There are currently six templates to choose from: Registration, Job started, Job Problem, Job Finished, Files Deleted Soon, Files have been Deleted, Password Reset.
Additional template arguments must be passed in through command line when the script is invoked.
Different arguments are preceded by their corresponding flag. e.g. -n flag indicates all successive arguments are of <n> type, until the next flag. 
Unrecognized flags will be ignored. Unnecessary arguments will be discarded.
For each argument, replace spaces with underscores.
Currently the flags are:
-t, template number
-n, names
-u, urls
-j, job names
-e, email addresses
-l, generic list arguments, such as a list of files. Pass the entire list as one argument
-d, destination email address

The script WILL resolve escape sequences.

example usage:
python EmailScript.py -t 0 -d kyin6@asu.edu -n Kai_Yin -u www.google.com 
this says, use template 0 (first template), send the email to kyin6@asu.edu, replace first n type argument with Kai_Yin, replace first u type argument with www.google.com
