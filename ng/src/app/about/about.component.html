    <h1>Welcome to Nanobase - the bionanotechnology database!</h1>

    <h2>Vision</h2>
    <p>
        Over the past 40 years, the nucleic acid nanotechnology community has 
        developed a vast array of both static and dynamic nanostructures which 
        self-assemble based on the principles of complementarity between bases. 
        These designed nanostructures have found their way into diverse applications 
        that include nanopatterning, drug delivery, diagnostics, and nanophotonics, 
        among others. However, frequently these structures are demonstrated, verified, 
        and published, but rarely do they achieve lasting impact as a structural 
        motif that is reused and propels the field forward. Rather, each lab builds 
        upon their own design, rather than reusing successful and verified nanostructures.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here, we hope to collect the design files for a variety of nanostructures and 
        store them in a community database to facilitate the sharing of design principles 
        to bring the community closer in collaboration and our designs to greater levels 
        of modularity and function. This effort comprises not only repository for DNA, RNA 
        and DNA/RNA-protein hybrid nanostructures, but also a supporting ecosystem of 
        tools to edit and characterize the structures. Our service encourages users to 
        convert their format into one common format using provided tools, and provides GUI 
        interface to edit and visualize structures. Each structure can hence be easily 
        adapted for various applications, exported to strands to order for experiment, 
        or directly used to simulate using our oxDNA.org server implementing coarse-grained 
        models of DNA, RNA and proteins.

    <h2>Uploading structures</h2>
    <p>
        Any researcher who would like to deposit a structure into Nanobase is welcome to create an account. 
        To begin, click the "Sign in" button in the upper right corner and select "Create an account". 
        Once you fill in the form and verify your email, you are ready to upload a structure. 
        Begin by clicking the "Upload Structure" button in the sidebar. This will take you to a form where 
        you enter structure information. Make sure to include purpose and keywords to make the structure 
        easily searchable by users in the future. The next page is where you enter publication information, 
        including any patents and licensing information if applicable. Finally, on the file upload page 
        you can include any files associated with an entry. At a minimum, we highly suggest uploading the following files:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>An original design file (for example, a Cadnano json file)</li>
        <li>The file converted to oxDNA format (using <a href="tacoxdna.sissa.it">tacoxdna</a> 
            if your design tool of choice does not have a built-in exporter)</li>
        <li>At least one image (idealized, simulated or experimental) to be shown as the entry photo.
            If you do not have one available, you can use the oxView tool to produce such an image from the oxDNA files.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        On this page you can also upload additional image files which will be shown in a gallery on the entry page, 
        as well as experimental and simulation protocols and results which you would like to share with the wider community.
    </p>

    <h2>Why oxDNA files?</h2>
    <p>
        Even if you did not perform simulations as part of your research on a structure,
        we ask that, if possible, you include your designed structure in oxDNA format
        as part of the database entry. The reasons for this are two-fold:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li><b>Visualization - </b>The Nanobase entry for a structure has an
            <a href="oxview.org">oxView</a> iframe on the structure view page.
            This provides a way to visualize the design in 3D.</li>
        <li><b>Interoperability - </b>Due to the wide availability of converters
            into the oxDNA format, (<a href="tacoxdna.sissa.it">tacoxdna</a> as well
            as built-in converters in many newer design tools), this format has become
            something of a neutral ground for DNA-RNA nanotechnology designs. Having
            the design file in oxDNA allows for easy re-combining of motifs drawn in
            different design tools, as well as facilitating free-form editing in oxView.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        Details about the oxDNA format can be found <a href="dna.physics.ox.ac.uk/index.php/Documentation#Configuration_and_topology_files">here</a>
        and additional information on representing peptides and proteins in oxDNA can be found
        <a href="github.com/sulcgroup/anm-oxdna/blob/master/oxDNA/ANMUtils/anm-oxdna-overview.pdf">here</a>.
        For structures designed in Cadnano and vHelix (rpoly format), it is also possible to load them directly
        in oxView and save the structure as a <a href="github.com/sulcgroup/oxdna-viewer">.oxview</a> file instead, which will maintain base-pairing
        and strand coloring information in the 3D visualization while being trivial to export as oxDNA simulation files.
        If you are interested in running an oxDNA simulation based on an entry found in Nanobase
        but don't have access to an HPC facility, <a href="oxdna.org">oxdna.org</a> is available as a
        free public webserver for running oxDNA simulations with a graphical interface.

    <h2>Who we are</h2>
    <p>
        Nanobase is developed and maintained by Aatmik Mallya, Erik Poppleton and Swarup Dey of <a href="https://www.public.asu.edu/~psulc/">Petr &#352;ulc</a> and 
        <a href="http://yanlab.asu.edu/">Hao Yan's</a> labs at Arizona State University.
        Our labs have extensive experience in nanostructure design, experiments, and simulation, and also dedicate significant effort to tool and methods 
        development to make the nanostructure design process easier.
