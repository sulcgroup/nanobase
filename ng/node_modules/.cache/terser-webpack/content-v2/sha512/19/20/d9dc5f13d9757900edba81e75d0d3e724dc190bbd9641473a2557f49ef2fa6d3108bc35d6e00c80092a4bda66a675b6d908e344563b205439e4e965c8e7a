These designed nanostructures have found their way intodiverse applications that include nanopatterning, drug delivery, diagnostics, and nanophotonics, among others. However, frequently these structures are demonstrated, verified, and published, but rarely do they achieve lasting impact as a structural motif that is reused and propels the field forward.

Our service encourages users to convert their format into one common format using provided tools, and provides GUI interface to edit and visualize structures.
