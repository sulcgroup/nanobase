However, frequently these structures are demonstrated, verified, and published, but rarely do they achieve lasting impact as a structural motif that is reused and propels the field forward. Here, we hope to collect the design files for a variety of nanostructures and store them in a community database to facilitate the sharing of design principles to bring the community closer in collaboration and our designs to greater levels of modularity and function.\\n\"),i.Qb(),i.Rb(6,\"h2\"),i.zc(7,\"Uploading structures\"),i.Qb(),i.Rb(8,\"p\"),i.zc(9,' Any researcher who would like to deposit a structure into Nanobase is welcome to create an account. To begin, click the \"Sign in\" button in the upper right corner and select \"Create an account\". Once you fill in the form and verify your email, you are ready to upload a structure. Begin by clicking the \"Upload Structure\" button in the sidebar. This will take you to a form where you enter structure information. Make sure to include purpose and keywords to make the structure easily searchable by users in the future. The next page is where you enter publication information, including any patents and licensing information if applicable. Finally, on the file upload page you can include any files associated with an entry.
