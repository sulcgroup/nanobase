These designed nanostructures have found their way intodiverse applications that include nanopatterning, drug delivery, diagnostics, and nanophotonics, among others. However, frequently these structures are demonstrated, verified, and published, but rarely do they achieve lasting impact as a structural motif that is reused and propels the field forward. Rather, each lab builds upon their own design, rather than reusing successful and verified nanostructures.\\n\"),i.Qb(),i.Rb(6,\"p\"),i.zc(7,\" Here, we hope to collect the design files for a variety of nanostructures and store them in a community database to facilitate the sharing of design principles to bring the community closer in collaboration and our designs to greater levels of modularity and function. This effortcomprises not only repository for DNA, RNA and DNA/RNA-protein hybrid nanostructures, but also a supporting ecosystem of tools to edit and characterize the structures. Our service encourages users to convert their format into one common format using provided tools, and provides GUI interface to edit and visualize structures.
